## Actionable Intelligence Report: Suspicious IP Addresses

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:** Unauthorized API Access & Potential Compromise

**Summary:**  Log analysis reveals two IP addresses exhibiting suspicious activity.  API key authentication issues prevent full threat assessment via VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB. However, preliminary analysis indicates a potential threat from one IP address.

**Critical Threats:**

* **18.237.3.202:** This IP address triggered a "suspicious_user_agent" flag and received a confidence score of 10, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The inability to query VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB due to API key issues hinders a complete assessment, but the existing data warrants immediate action.

* **14.103.172.199:** This IP address shows no suspicious user agent and a confidence score of 0. While currently benign, it requires further investigation considering the API access error.


**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Resolve API Key Issues:** Immediately rectify the authentication problems with VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB APIs to enable full threat intelligence gathering on both IP addresses.

2. **Prioritize Investigation of 18.237.3.202:**  Focus on investigating 18.237.3.202. Once API access is restored, conduct comprehensive analysis using VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB.  This includes checking for reported malicious activity, spam reports, and other indicators of compromise.

3. **Review Firewall Logs:** Examine firewall logs for activity originating from both IP addresses, focusing on any unusual port activity or attempts to access sensitive systems.  Look for connection attempts before the current observation.

4. **Implement Temporary Blocking (Considered):**  While waiting for API results, consider temporarily blocking 18.237.3.202 at the firewall as a precautionary measure. This should be weighed against potential disruption of legitimate traffic (consider whitelisting exceptions if necessary).

5. **Investigate 14.103.172.199 after 18.237.3.202:** After addressing the more critical threat, conduct a thorough analysis of 14.103.172.199.  Even though currently benign, understanding its access attempt is vital for overall security posture.

6. **Incident Response Plan:**  Based on findings, initiate the relevant incident response plan, including containment, eradication, and recovery steps.

**Reporting:** Update this report with the findings from the above steps.
