## Actionable Intelligence Report - Suspicious IP Addresses

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:**  High Confidence of Malicious Activity from IP Addresses 18.237.3.202 and 14.103.172.199

**1. Executive Summary:**

This report analyzes two IP addresses flagged by the security monitoring system.  IP address 18.237.3.202 exhibits a high confidence score (10/10) due to a suspicious user agent and multiple positive malicious flags from VirusTotal despite the IP address belonging to Amazon. IP address 14.103.172.199 presents a lower immediate threat but warrants investigation due to multiple VirusTotal flags indicating malicious or suspicious activity.  Both require immediate attention.

**2. Critical Threats:**

* **18.237.3.202 (High Priority):**  This IP, despite being registered to Amazon, shows a high confidence score and a suspicious user agent.  The "Criminal IP" and "EmergingThreats" blacklists flag it as malicious, indicating potential compromise or malicious use of an Amazon resource. The suspicious user agent further strengthens this suspicion.  Immediate action is required to determine the extent of compromise and prevent further activity.

* **14.103.172.199 (Medium Priority):** This IP address, located in China and associated with ByteDance (Volcano Engine), shows several malicious flags ("Criminal IP," "Certego," "CyRadar," "Fortinet," and "VIPRE") on VirusTotal. This suggests potential malicious activity emanating from this source. While the confidence score is lower, the multiple positive flags warrant investigation.

**3. Immediate Next Steps:**

* **18.237.3.202:**
    * **Isolate:** Immediately isolate the affected system(s) communicating with 18.237.3.202 to prevent further compromise.
