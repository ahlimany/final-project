**Actionable Intelligence Report**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:** Suspicious IP Addresses Identified

**1. Executive Summary:**

Two IP addresses, 18.237.3.202 and 14.103.172.199, have been flagged as potentially malicious based on VirusTotal analysis.  While 14.103.172.199 shows a lower confidence score, 18.237.3.202 exhibits multiple indicators of compromise (IOCs) warranting immediate attention.  Cisco Talos data is unavailable due to API limitations.


**2. Critical Threats:**

* **18.237.3.202:** This IP address is flagged as malicious by several reputable sources (Criminal IP, CRDF, CyRadar, EmergingThreats, Fortinet, VIPRE) and shows a suspicious user agent.  The high number of "suspicious" and "malicious" flags in the VirusTotal report (11 out of 85) indicates a high probability of malicious activity. The IP address is associated with Amazon Technologies Inc., suggesting potential compromise of an Amazon cloud service or abuse of a legitimate Amazon resource.

* **14.103.172.199:** This IP address, associated with Beijing Volcano Engine Technology Co., Ltd. (a ByteDance subsidiary), receives a lower confidence score. However,  flags from Criminal IP, Certego, CyRadar, and SOCRadar (malicious), merit further investigation, especially considering the reputation score of -3 from VirusTotal.

**3. Immediate Next Steps:**

* **High Priority (18.237.3.202):**
    * **Block:** Immediately block all inbound and outbound traffic from 18.237.3.202 at the firewall and network perimeter.
    * **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if there's any evidence of intrusion or data exfiltration originating from or targeting this IP. Analyze network logs for connections, examining timestamps, data transfer volumes, and protocols.
    * **Alerting:** Review and refine intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to ensure accurate detection of similar threats in the future.
    * **Incident Response:**  If an intrusion is confirmed, execute a full incident response plan, containing containment, eradication, recovery and post-incident activity.  Focus on identifying and remediating any affected systems or data.


* **Medium Priority (14.103.172.199):**
    * **Monitoring:**  Closely monitor network traffic associated with this IP address.
    * **Correlation:** Correlate this IP with other observed threats or suspicious activities within the network.
    * **Further Investigation:** Conduct deeper analysis if additional suspicious activity is detected related to this IP.  This may require expanding the investigation to include ByteDance's infrastructure or specific services used by the organization.


**4. Reporting:**

This report should be escalated to relevant management and security teams.  A subsequent report outlining the complete investigation findings and remediation steps will follow.  The ongoing monitoring of both IP addresses should be documented.
