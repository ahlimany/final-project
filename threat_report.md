## Actionable Intelligence Report - Suspicious IP Addresses

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:** High-Confidence Threat Indicators Identified

**Summary:**  Analysis of two IP addresses, 18.237.3.202 and 14.103.172.199, reveals indicators of potential malicious activity.  While both IPs show a mix of harmless and malicious classifications, the high confidence score for 18.237.3.202 warrants immediate action.

**Critical Threats:**

* **18.237.3.202 (High Priority):** This IP address registered a "malicious" result from multiple reputable sources (Criminal IP, CRDF, CyRadar, EmergingThreats, Fortinet, VIPRE), indicating potential involvement in malware distribution or other malicious activities.  The "suspicious" results from alphaMountain.ai, AlphaSOC, and ArcSight Threat Intelligence reinforce this assessment.  The high confidence score (10) further emphasizes this threat.  The presence of a *suspicious_user_agent* flag adds to concern.

* **14.103.172.199 (Medium Priority):** This IP address shows fewer "malicious" flags than 18.237.3.202 but displays "malicious" results from sources like Criminal IP, Certego, CyRadar, and SOCRadar, suggesting possible involvement in malicious activities.  The negative reputation score (-3) from VirusTotal is notable.


**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Block 18.237.3.202:** Immediately implement network-level blocking of this IP address at all ingress and egress points to prevent further potential compromise.

2. **Investigate 18.237.3.202 Activity:**  Analyze logs for any connections originating from or destined to this IP.
